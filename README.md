# Insta-Unfollowers-List
Very small Python script that gets Instagram unfollowers from your 'followers.json' and 'following.json' files.

You can get these files via Instagram's Privacy and Security section -> Request Download (JSON). Place then in the same directory as this script and run it.

A new file "unfollowers.txt" will be created in that same directory with a list of all the unfollowers in the format "user1 \n user2 \n ..."
