# Insta-Unfollowers-List
Small Python script that gets Instagram unfollowers from 'connections.json' file.

You can get this file via Instagram's App -> Settings -> Security -> Download Data
Place it in the same directory as this script and run it. You'll get a new file "unfs.txt" created in that same directory with a list of all the unfollowers in the format "user1 \n user2 \n ..."
