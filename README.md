# Insta-Unfollowers-List
Very small Python script that gets Instagram unfollowers from your 'connections.json' file.

You can get this file via Instagram's App -> Settings -> Security -> Download Data. Place it in the same directory as this script and run it.

A new file "unfs.txt" will be created in that same directory with a list of all the unfollowers in the format "user1 \n user2 \n ..."
